ADD YOUR MUSIC FILES HERE
=========================

1. Add your MP3 files to this folder:
   - track1.mp3
   - track2.mp3
   - track3.mp3
   (or rename them to match what's in js/musicPlayer.js)

2. Supported formats: .mp3, .wav, .ogg

3. Update the playlist in js/musicPlayer.js if you want different track names or more songs.

That's it! The music player will automatically use these files.
