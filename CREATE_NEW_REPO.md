# Create New GitHub Repository - Quick Steps

## Step 1: Create Repository on GitHub

1. Go to: https://github.com/new
2. Fill in:
   - **Repository name**: `kirti-birthday` (or any name you prefer)
   - **Description**: "Interactive birthday website for Kirti"
   - **Visibility**: Choose **Public** (for free GitHub Pages)
   - **DO NOT** check "Add a README file" (we already have one)
   - **DO NOT** add .gitignore or license (we have them)
3. Click **"Create repository"**

## Step 2: Copy the Repository URL

After creating, GitHub will show you a page with commands. Copy the repository URL, it will look like:
```
https://github.com/vardhan24bcs10041/kirti-birthday.git
```

## Step 3: Tell Me the Repository Name

Once you've created it, tell me the repository name and I'll update your git remote and push everything!
